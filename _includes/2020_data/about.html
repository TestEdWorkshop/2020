            <b>Important update!</b> TestEd is postponed to October 28 due to the current outbreak of COVID-19 and the travel restrictions that
            follows. TestEd is co-located with ICST so please read their <a href="https://t.co/1SVFY61iFE"> statement to the ICST community</a> and their list of <a href="https://icst2020.info/attending/icst-has-been-postponed%2521">frequently 
            asked questions</a> for more information.

            <p>
            TestEd 2020 is the first workshop entirely focused on education in software testing&mdash;how to teach and learn software testing 
            and how to get more software testing into the classrooms. TestEd will bring together researchers and practitioners who teach 
            software testing to share and discuss their experience and best advice on how to bring more and better software testing 
            education into courses.

        <h2>Call for contributions</h2>
            <p>
            TestEd 2020 focuses on knowledge diffusion of software testing&mdash;especially how to teach it. The research community has created enormous 
            amounts of knowledge for how to test software, yet many professional software engineers have little of this knowledge. 
            This is despite the fact that testing is crucial to the success of all types of modern software products. We will 
            specifically focus on two goals. First, how can we teach more testing within computing degrees? Second, how can we better 
            teach the knowledge and skills of software testing? This workshop will give an opportunity for those who teach testing to 
            share their ideas, and for us all to learn more about teaching software testing.    
            </p>
        <h2> Topics and types of contributions </h2>
            <p>
            Topics include&mdash;but are not limited to&mdash;teaching materials,
            active classroom exercises,
            theory vs. practice
            how to solve classroom problems,
            how to teach specific skills (test design, test automation etc.),\
            how to teach students to think like a tester, and
            professional ethics.
            Shared experiences could come from courses at any level in academia or industry. It could also come 
            from teaching a dedicated course in software testing or a software engineering course where testing is a small part. 
            
            Our goal is to have a minimum of “talk at” and a maximum of “sharing with.” Hence, we are looking for multiple types of contributions, 
            including traditional paper-based presentations, mini-talks about specific strategies and tactics, or 
            demonstrations of classroom activities.
            We also welcome you to organize an activity such as a group discussion about tricks 
            of the trade or an audience-focused panel to answer questions about teaching software testing.
            We accept:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Full papers (6-8 pages) </li>
                <li> Short papers (2-4 pages) </li>
                <li> Mini-talk proposals (1 page) </li>
                <li> Demonstration activity proposal (1 page) </li>
                <li> Panels and group discussion proposals (1 page) </li>
                <li> Other activity proposals (1 page) </li>
            </ul>
            <h2> Important dates </h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Submission deadline: December <ins>23</ins> (extended deadline) </li>
                <li> Notification of acceptance: January 24 </li>
                <li> Camera ready: January 31 </li>
            </ul>
            <h2> Submission </h2>
            <p>
            Full and short papers must conform to the two columns IEEE conference publication format and must be submitted in PDF 
            format via <a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences?conf=tested2020" target="_blank">EasyChair</a>. These submissions will be evaluated according to the relevance and originality of the work and 
            to their ability to generate discussions between the participants of the workshop. Three reviewers will review each 
            paper and all the accepted papers will be published as part of the <a href="https://icst2020.info/" target="_blank">ICST</a> proceedings.

            Proposals for mini-talks, demonstrations, discussions or other need not to conform to the publication format but 
            should be limited to one page, 10p, and submitted in PDF via <a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences?conf=tested2020" target="_blank">EasyChair</a>.
            These submissions will be evaluated 
            according to several criteria, including novelty, potential for participants to learn,
            and maturity of the planned session.
            Three reviewers will evaluate each proposal. 

            All materials for accepted contributions, including slides, summaries, and lesson plans,
            will be published on a public website.
            </p>   
            <h2> Special issue on software testing education </h2>
            <p>
            Well received contributions will be invited to a special issue on test education in the journal of Software Testing, 
            Verification, and Reliability.
